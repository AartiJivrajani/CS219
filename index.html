        <h1>Hi there, I'm Aarti Jivrajani!</h1>
        <p>I love to travel, especially to places where I can just kick back and listen to nothing other than my own breath</p>
        <p>One such place is Ulu Watu, one the most beautiful places in Bali to watch the sunset. I was lucky to have
        found the perfect spot to watch the sun set</p>
        <img src="Project0/sunset.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="sunset at Ulu Watu">
        <p>Speaking of amazing places to visit in Bali, visit <a href="/CS219/Project0/bali.html">this</a> page for a
            couple places I wouldn't mind going back to again and again....</p>

            <td>Tanah Lot is a temple sitting atop a large rock formation. Over the years, the high tide has
                separated the rock from the mainland. A must visit if you want to just close your eyes and listen to
                sea waves crashing on the rocks along with a mellow chime of the temple bells</td>

                recall my "zen" moment, I would ALWAYS talk about the time I went scuba diving in the waters of Bali.
                The only sound you can hear is that of you breathing and the air bubbles coming out of your scuba mask.
