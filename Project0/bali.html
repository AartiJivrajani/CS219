                separated the rock from the mainland. A must visit if you want to just close your eyes and listen to
                sea waves crashing on the rocks along with a mellow chime of the temple bells</td>

                recall my "zen" moment, I would ALWAYS talk about the time I went scuba diving in the waters of Bali.
                The only sound you can hear is that of you breathing and the air bubbles coming out of your scuba mask.
                They say silence can be deafening, but believe me, this silence was pure bliss!</td>
